# Theme switcher

Basically it's a toggle that turn the background theme to dark and light.

## How it works? :zap:

- At the first time the *light theme* is set by **default**.
  
- You may click on the toggle to turn the theme. 
  
- I also made a function that storage the last theme set 

- The toggle is appended in the body of the page

- I built a function that verify if the toggle is already

## How to add in your own project? :fire:
- You must download
  - JS Files
  - Style Files (scss it's not necessary)
  - Images Files
- You must include in your HTML the type="module"
```<script type="module" src="main.js"><script/>```
  
Check the code! üöÄ :heart_eyes:
